            Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at NUS with a minor in Quantitative Finance, currently in my third year and expected to graduate by the end of the year. Iâ€™m passionate about AI/ML, product management, and building meaningful tech solutions that bridge people and technology. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects that youâ€™ll find on this site â€” each a small experiment in learning, design, and impact. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing football (and most other sports) on weekends and traveling whenever I get the chance ðŸ˜Ž.
